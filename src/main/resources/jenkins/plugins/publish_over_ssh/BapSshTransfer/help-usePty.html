    <p>Exec the command in a pseudo tty</p>
    <p>This will enable the execution of sudo commands that require a tty (and possibly help in other scenarios too.)<br />
    From the sudoers(5) man page:
    <pre><tt>requiretty      If set, sudo will only run when the user is logged in
                to a real tty.  When this flag is set, sudo can only be
                run from a login session and not via other means such
                as cron(8) or cgi-bin scripts.  This flag is off by
                default.
    </tt></pre>
