<div>
    <p>First part of the file path that should not be created on the remote server.</p>
    <p>Directory structures are created relative to the base directory, which is usually the workspace.<br />
    You normally do not want the full path to these files to be created on the server.<br />
    For example if Source files were <code>target/deployment/images/**/</code> then you may want Remove prefix to be
    <code>target/deployment</code> This would create the images folder under the remote directory, and not target/deployment<br />
    Jenkins environment variables can be used in this path.</p>
    <p><strong>If you use remove prefix, then ALL source file paths MUST start with the prefix.</strong></p>
