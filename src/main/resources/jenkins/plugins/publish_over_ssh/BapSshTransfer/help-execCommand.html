    <p>A command to execute on the remote server</p>
    <p>This command will be executed on the remote server after any files are transferred.<br />
       The SSH Transfer Set must include either a Source Files pattern, an Exec command, or both. If both are present, the files are
       transferred before the command is executed. If you want to Exec before the files are transferred, use 2 Transfer Sets and move the
       Exec command before the Transfer set that includes a Source files pattern.
