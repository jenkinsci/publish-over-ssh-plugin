<div>
    <p>Select to publish from the Jenkins master.</p>
    <p>The default is to publish from the server that holds the files to transfer (workspace on the slave, or artifacts directory on the master)<br />
    Enabling this option could help dealing with strict network configurations and firewall rules.<br />
    This option will cause the files to be transferred through the master before being sent to the remote server, this may
    increase network traffic, and could increase the build time.</p>
