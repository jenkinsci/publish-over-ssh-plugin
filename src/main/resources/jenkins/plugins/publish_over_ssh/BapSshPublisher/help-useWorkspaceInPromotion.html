<div>
    <p>Set the root directory for the Source files to the workspace.</p>
    <p>By default this plugin uses the artifacts directory (where archived artifacts are stored). This allows the artifacts
    from the build number that you are promoting to be sent somewhere else.</p>
    <p>If you run tasks that produce files in the workspace during the promotion and you want to publish them, then set this
        option.</p>
    <p>If you need to send files from both the workspace and the archive directory, then you need to add a second server,
        even if you want to send the files to the same place. This is due to the fact that the workspace is not necessarily
        on the same host as the archive directory.</p>
