    <p>Use the build time of the promotion when the remote directory is a date format.</p>
    <p>By default this plugin uses the time of the original build (the one that is being promoted) when formatting the
        remote directory. Setting this option will mean that if you use the remote directory is a date format option,
        it will use the time that the promotion process runs, instead of the original build.</p>
